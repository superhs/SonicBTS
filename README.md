# Sonic BTS: Definitive Edition
## A fan game by LakeFeperd, and modified by superhs
SBTS: DS is a fork of LakeFeperd's Sonic Before The Sequel source code. You can get said source code [here.](https://sites.google.com/view/lakesage2018/main)
Keep in mind that these versions are only openable with an old version of Windows 10 or Windows 7, due to Flash being long gone. R.I.P. Flash.

leonardo, a member of the [Hedge Land discord server](https://dc.railgun.works/HedgeLand) has created a fixed version of said source code without the requirement of Flash, however this means all cutscenes now show up as black yucky screens. Nobody likes black yucky screens, so this versions fixes that as well as adds many other things. Such as:
- Widescreen support
- Sprite improvements (Certain sprites have been replaced with their counterparts from After The Sequel DX)
- Cutscene updates (All run at widescreen, with little to no differences from their original Flash counterparts)
- and more!

## To open this source code, you will need:
1. [Clickteam Fusion 2.5](https://www.clickteam.com/clickteam-fusion-2-5), a game development software that retails for around $100 USD, and a few extensions which you can get from the built-in Extension Manager or from [here.](https://www.clickteam.com/cem)
2. Good editors for everything if you want to make changes to the game without using the bad built-in ones (for sprites, i reccomend either [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) or [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/), and for audio i reccomend [Audacity.](https://www.audacityteam.org/))
3. A decent knowledge of how Fusion works and how Sonic Worlds [(the engine this game runs on)](https://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Worlds) are needed, of course.

## And thats basically it! Have a great day modifying the .mfa!
